# TwitterMapperStarter

## Final project for MicroMasters "Software Development" - Software Construction: Object-Oriented Design

### Assignment

For the project you will complete a graphical Java application called The Twitter Mapper. This application allows the user to specify keywords of interest, and monitors tweets from a service that samples Twitter in real time (or replays tweets that were previously recorded). It also plots the location of the user the originated the tweet on a map of the world. To do this, the app makes use of an existing geographical mapping library and the Twitter API.
